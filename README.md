**Merkle ERC20 Airdrop** â€“ A gas-efficient, verifiable token distribution system leveraging Merkle Trees for secure claim verification. Built with Solidity and OpenZeppelin Contracts, this implementation enables eligible addresses to claim ERC20 tokens by providing a valid Merkle proof, ensuring scalable and tamper-proof airdrop processes without storing the entire recipient list on-chain.

## Features

- Gas-efficient bulk distribution
- Merkle proof verification
- One-time claim enforcement
- ERC20 token support
- OpenZeppelin security patterns

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`
